This a convolutional Neural Network just as U-Net to segment pavement crack from background. This code is taken from source of DeepCrack. We are planning to fine tune DeepCrack 
on our pavement distress datasets. We are going through several test runs on CRACKTRE260 and EdmCrack600 and other published pavement distress datasets.
