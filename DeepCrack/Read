This a convolutional Neural Network just as U-Net to segment pavement crack from background. This code is taken from source of DeepCrack (https://github.com/qinnzou/DeepCrack). We are planning to fine tune DeepCrack 
on our pavement distress datasets. We are going through several test runs on CRACKTRE260 and EdmCrack600 and other published pavement distress datasets.
